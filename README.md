## Overview of Project

https://public.tableau.com/profile/jose.santos4967#!/vizhome/Module14Challenge_16205284163930/Bike_Sharing?publish=yes

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis was to demonstrate that based on NYC bike sharing data, a similar business in Des Moines would likely succeed.

## Results

### User interface

When the webpage loads, the unfiltered page shows all of the sightings:

Filtering the data by the city "el cajon" by entering "el cajon" in the "enter city field" and pressing enter produces the filtered table:

Filtering on date (01/13/2010) produced the filtered table:

If we then add an additional filter to the date, by entering "pa" in the "enter state" field, we obtain the following filtered table:

## Summary

### Drawbacks of current webpage
One drawback of the current design of this webpage is that it does not have a reset button to remove all filters and show the initial unfiltered table.

### Suggested Additional developments
The following additional developments would really help to improve the user interface:
1. The implementation of a reset button that when pressed would remove all the filters AND show the unfiltered data again.
2. Whenever the sighting had a photograph, it would be great to be able to add it so that viewers could see it.
