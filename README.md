## Overview of Project

https://public.tableau.com/profile/jose.santos4967#!/vizhome/Module14Challenge_16205284163930/Bike_Sharing?publish=yes

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis was to create a webpage that contained information on UFO sightings including date, city, state, country, shape of UFO, duration of sighting and showed comments on the sighting in a table format.  To make it easier to find specific sightings, the webpage provided the ability filter by multiple or single criteria (sightings by date, city, state, country and shape of UFO). 

## Results

### User interface

When the webpage loads, the unfiltered page shows all of the sightings:

Filtering the data by the city "el cajon" by entering "el cajon" in the "enter city field" and pressing enter produces the filtered table:

Filtering on date (01/13/2010) produced the filtered table:

If we then add an additional filter to the date, by entering "pa" in the "enter state" field, we obtain the following filtered table:

## Summary

### Drawbacks of current webpage
One drawback of the current design of this webpage is that it does not have a reset button to remove all filters and show the initial unfiltered table.

### Suggested Additional developments
The following additional developments would really help to improve the user interface:
1. The implementation of a reset button that when pressed would remove all the filters AND show the unfiltered data again.
2. Whenever the sighting had a photograph, it would be great to be able to add it so that viewers could see it.
